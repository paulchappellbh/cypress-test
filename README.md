# Instructions

Run the following commands to get the sample express app running:
`npm install`
`npm start`

This will launch the web app on your local machine at `http://localhost:3000`.

Please write a Cypress test in the `/cypress/integration` folder to verify the content on the page.

You may wish to use the `mock-content-data.json` file as this contains some mock data that is used to render the web page.  This would ordinarily be served by the content management system.

In order to run the Cypress test, use the following command:
`npm test`
